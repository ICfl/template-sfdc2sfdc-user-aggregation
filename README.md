## Use Case
As a admin I want to see a report of SFDC users that belong to each organisation to be able to detect inconsistencies between users permissions between organisations.

## Run it!

Simple steps to get SFDC to SFDC Users report running [here] (https://github.com/mulesoft/sfdc2sfdc-usersreport/wiki/Run-SFDC2SFDC-UsersReport-Mule-Kick!).

## Details

Having an idea on how this Kick is built and how can you customise it can be found [here] (https://github.com/mulesoft/sfdc2sfdc-usersreport/wiki/How-this-kick-was-built.-Customise-it!).
